		 		Student Information System (SIS) is a web-based 
		 		application software designed to introduce a conducive and structured 
		 		information exchange environment for integrating students, parents, 
		 		teachers and the administration of a school or college. Some of the 
		 		other software packages available for this purpose include Student Management System (SMS), 
		 		Student Information Management System (SIMS) and Student Records System (SRS). These software systems enable educational institutions 
		 		to supervise student-related activities such as keeping records of tests or examinations conducted, attendance, appraisal on performance including details of marks scored, particulars of 
		 		everyday school attendance, and all other institution-related activities; in short, they provide a complete student records system. They are designed with diverse application potentials ranging 
		 		from simple management of students records at school to management of all student-related functions as well as administrative functions of a university or a chain of educational establishments.
